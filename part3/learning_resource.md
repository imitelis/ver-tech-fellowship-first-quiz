## Favorite technology learning resource

My favorite technology learning resource is actually YouTube. I follow plenty of channels on the platform and I like to watch a lot of videos involving a wide range of topics; new technologies, life coaching and even scientific research. However, I think that the best way to learn is by actually working and not just by watching others, so if I like the videos content, I'm very likely start a new project and begin coding. Most of the times I also end up using google to find more information and documentation about the programming languages and libraries that I learn about. If I get stuck I will probably check the terminal and ask some questions to the  browser. And if I want to take a break from my work or study, I usually take a walk and keep thinking about the problem. Eventually, something has to come up.
